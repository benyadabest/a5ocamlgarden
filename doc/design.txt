*Overview*
This simulation models organic-patterned distributed plant growth in a 2D grid-based garden, where plants exhibit basic lifecycle behaviors. 
Each plant grows, loses health over time, reproduces when it reaches a certain size, and eventually dies. 

*Plant Dynamics*
Each plant starts with a specific health value that decreases with each time step. Dies if reach 0 or max height or age 20.
Each plant has 20% chance to grow each time step. Stops at maxinum height of 7.
If plant reaches height of 5, new plant randomly chosen adjacent cell (if available).
if reaches max height of 7, seeds additional plant randomly chosen adjacent cell (if available).
Age increments by 1 each step.

*Garden Dynamics*
Fixed size 2D grid that's customized on creation. 
Each time step, garden iterates over each plant to apply growth, health, reproduction, and death rules.
Randomness applied to growth, reproduction, and seeding. Creates variety in garden's appearance and evolution over time. 
Green and * represents plants with age less than 5, green represents growth
Yellow and o represents plants with age between 5 and 10, yellow represents stability
Red and T represents plants with age greater than 10, red represents ending of lifecycle

*Simulation Logic*
Initializes with randomly placed plants.
Updates rules at each time steps, all plants health decreases, 20% chance of growing, if height is 5 -> seed adjacent plant, if height is 7 -> die and seed adjacent plant.

It should be engaging and plants growing in empty areas is natural!
